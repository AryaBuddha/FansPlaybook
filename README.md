FansPlaybook is a solution that helps fan engagement officials by providing them with an immersive, mobile game that will keep spectators engaged during breaks and halftime. It also engages those who decide to get out of their seats for breaks

FansPlaybook places Second overall, and recieved a special award for the best design. 

The code here is the backend of the mobile app. It is **NOT** complete, and only contains key features. The mobile app was modeled but not fully coded. The design can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/T5zOY0HTuV742LVLVCUuhe/FansPlaybook?node-id=0%3A1).
